# H.E.L.E.N.
H.E.L.E.N. (Haplotype Embedded Long-read Error-corrector for Nanopore)


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kishwarshafin/helen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/kishwarshafin/helen)

`HELEN` is a polisher intended to use for polishing human-genome assemblies generated by the [Shasta](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta) assembler. `HELEN` operates on the pileup summary generated by [MarginPolish](https://github.com/UCSC-nanopore-cgl/marginPolish). `MarginPolish` uses a probabilistic graphical-model to encode read alignments through a draft assembly to find the maximum-likelihood consensus sequence. The graphical-model operates in run-length space, which helps to reduce errors in homopolymeric regions. `MarginPolish` can produce tensor-like summaries encapsulating the internal likelihood weights. The weights are assigned to each genomic position over multiple likely outcomes that is suitable for inference by a Deep Neural Network model.

`HELEN` uses a Recurrent-Neural-Network (RNN) based Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model that can predict a base and a run-length for each genomic position using the weights generated by `MarginPolish`. The combination of `Shasta-MarginPolish-HELEN` produces state-of-the-art Oxford Nanopore based human genome assemblies.

## Installation
`MarginPolish` and `HELEN` can be used in Linux-based system. Users can install `MarginPolish` and `HELEN` on <b>`Ubuntu 18.04`</b> by following this document.

### Step 1: Install MarginPolish

To install MarginPolish in a Ubuntu/Linux bases system, follow these instructions:

##### Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install cmake make gcc g++ autoconf bzip2 lzma-dev zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get -y install libcurl4-openssl-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libbz2-dev
sudo apt-get -y install liblzma-dev libhdf5-dev
```

##### Install marginPolish
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCSC-nanopore-cgl/marginPolish.git
cd marginPolish
git submodule update --init
```
Make a build directory:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

Generate makefile:
```bash
cmake ..
make
./marginPolish
# to create a symlink
ln -s marginPolish /usr/local/bin
```

### Step 2: Install HELEN with GPU

Although `HELEN` can be used in a `CPU` only machine, we highly recommend using a machine with `GPU`.

This requires installing `CUDA` and the right `PyTorch` version compiled against the installed version of `CUDA`.

##### Install CUDA
To download `CUDA` for `Ubuntu 18.04` follow these insructions:
```bash
# download CUDA for ubuntu 18.04 x86_64 by running:
wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.0/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.0.130_410.48_linux
# if you are using other systems please download the correct version from here:
# https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive

# install CUDA by running:
sudo sh cuda_10.0.130_410.48_linux.run
# 1) Read or scroll through the EULA (you can press 'z' to scroll down).
# 2) Accept the EULA, put yes for OpenGL library, CUDA toolkit.
#    Installing CUDA-samples is optional

# once installed, verify the right version by running:
cat /usr/local/cuda/version.txt
# Expected output: CUDA Version 10.0.130

# Verify that you can see your GPU status by running:
nvidia-smi
```

##### Install PyTorch
Please follow the instructions from this [pytorch-installation-guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the right `PyTorch` version.

```bash
# if you are using Ubuntu 18.04, python3 version 3.6.7 and CUDA 10.0 then follow these commands:
python3 -m pip install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu100/torch-1.1.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
python3 -m pip install torchvision

# otherwise install the right version by following the instructions from:
# https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
```

We have tested these PyTorch versions against `HELEN` to ensure GPU accelerated inference:
* PyTorch 1.0 with CUDA 10.0
* PyTorch 1.1 with CUDA 10.0

To ensure `PyTorch` is using `CUDA`, you can follow these instructions:
```bash
$ python3
>>> import torch
>>> torch.cuda.is_available()
TRUE
# the expected output is TRUE
```

#### Install HELEN
`HELEN` requires `cmake` and `python3` to be installed in the system.
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install cmake
sudo apt-get -y install python3
sudo apt-get -y install python3-dev
```
To install `HELEN`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kishwarshafin/helen.git
cd helen
./build.sh
```

These steps will install `HELEN` in your local system. `HELEN` also requires installing some python3 packages.
```bash
python3 -m pip install h5py tqdm numpy torchnet
```

We also maintain an [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) on how to install `MarginPolish` and `HELEN` for reference.

## Usage
`MarginPolish` requires a draft assembly and a mapping of reads to the draft assembly. We commend using `Shasta` as the initial assembler and `MiniMap2` for the mapping.

#### Step 1: Generate an initial assembly
Although any assembler can be used to generate the initial assembly, we highly recommend using [Shasta](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta).

Please see the [quick start documentation](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/shasta/QuickStart.html) to see how to use Shasta. Shasta requires memory intensive computing.
> For a human size assembly, AWS instance type x1.32xlarge is recommended. It is usually available at a cost around $4/hour on the AWS spot market and should complete the human size assembly in a few hours, at coverage around 60x.

An assembly can be generated by running:
```bash
# you may need to convert the fastq to a fasta file
shasta/shasta-Linux-0.1.0 --input <reads.fa> --output <path_to_shasta_output>
```

#### Step 2: Create an alignment between reads and shasta assembly
We recommend using `MiniMap2` to generate the mapping between the reads and the assembly.
```bash
# we recommend using FASTQ as marginPolish uses quality values
# This command can run MiniMap2 with 32 threads, you can change the number as you like.
minimap2 -ax map-ont -t 32 shasta_assembly.fa reads.fq | samtools sort -@ 32 | samtools view -hb -F 0x104 > reads_2_assembly.bam
samtools index -@32 reads_2_assembly.bam

#  the -F 0x104 flag removes unaligned and secondary sequences
```
#### Step 3: Generate images using MarginPolish
To generate images with MarginPolish run:
```bash
marginPolish \
</path/to/reads_2_assembly.bam> \
<path/to/shasta_assembly.fa> \
<path/to/marginpolish/params/allParams.np.human.guppy-ff-235.json> \
-t <number_of_threads> \
-o </path/to/marginpolish_output/marginpolish_images> \
-f 2>&1 | tee </path/to/marginpolish.log>
```

#### Step 4: Run HELEN

##### Download Model
Before running `call_consensus.py` please download the appropriate model suitable for your data. Please read our [model guideline](#Model) to understand which model to pick.

##### Run call_consensus.py
First we have to run `call_consensus.py` to generate all the predictions:
```bash
python3 call_consensus.py \
--image_file </path/to/marginpolish_output/marginpolish_images> \
--batch_size 512 \
--model_path <path/to/helen_models/HELEN_v0_lc_r941_flip233_hap.pkl> \
--output_dir <path/to/helen_out/consensus_sequence/> \
--num_workers 32 \
--gpu_mode 1

# you can run CPU inference by removing --gpu_mode parameter
```

##### Run stitch.py
Finally you can run `stitch.py` to get a consensus sequence:
```bash
python3 stitch.py \
--sequence_hdf <path/to/helen_out/consensus_sequence/helen_predictions.hdf> \
--output_dir <path/to/helen_out/consensus_sequence/> \
--threads 32
```

<b>NOTE: We are working on a documentation with instructions for running this pipeline end-to-end.  </b>

We have seen significant difference in the homopolymer base-calls between different basecallers. It is important to pick the right version for the best polishing results.

[Ryan Lorig-Roach](https://github.com/rlorigro) generated confusion matrix for each step of the assembly.
We can see the difference in base caller versions to understand the imporantance of picking the right model.

#### Model Schema

HELEN implements a Recurrent-Neural-Network (RNN) based Multi-task learning model with hard parameter sharing. It implements a sliding window method where it slides through the input sequence in chunks. As each input sequence is evaluated independently, it allows HELEN to use mini-batch during training and testing.
